# Introduction #

I and the CE Team are working on a project to give you better options to a wonderful movie date with your loved one.

She wants to watch a Romantic Comedy and you want to watch a Thriller. How to find it in your 1 TB movie collection? One by one...

And then we came along to give you a better option... (Zombieland)

# What the hell is this? #

It's a software that scans your movies, fetches data from IMDB or Rottentomaties and stores important data locally:

  * Date of release
  * Oscar Nominations
  * First 4 billed actors
  * Themes (Horror, Comedy, Noir)
  * IMDB / RT Ratings
  * Plot Summery
  * and whatsoever you like

# Why do I need this? #

"I can just go on imdb.com and stare at the rating myself. Why do I need it locally?"

Because I say you do.

  * Don't you wan't to sort your **own** collection using your own criteria
  * Do you really like going online all the time to check who played what in what?
  * Don't you want to know if you have another movie by Christopher Nolan in your collection that you still haven't watched?

Yes, you do.

# Sooo, when? #

Pretty soon.
