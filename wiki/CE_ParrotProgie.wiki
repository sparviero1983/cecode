This file is to demonstrate the CE Installation method, with the included graphics and logo.

= Introduction =

The installer is made using Inno Setup: http://www.innosetup.com/isinfo.php

The demo program is written in Python(2.5) by xheavenlyx.

= Details =

The Parrot method is explained here (as much as I could at 2am):

A given number or series of numbers will be counted and then the output is incremented in the same way.

*Example*:

You enter the number 2113
The output will be: one2 two1 one3 but it will be output(-ed?) as a normal integer. like: 122113

If you enter the number of iterations, it will keep applying the parrot to consecutive out puts.
